# Lab 01: Agent Discovery and Registry Management

## Introduction

Zava's CISO has asked the security team to confirm that all deployed AI agents are visible, governed, and accounted for before any security policy work begins. Patti Fernandes, Zava's Security Admin and SOC Analyst, will use the Agent Registry in Microsoft Entra ID to inspect the three Zava agents, test lifecycle controls, and identify any governance gaps. The Defender XDR workspace and Defender for Cloud Apps connector will also be initialised so that agent activity data begins flowing before moving further in the security journey.

This lab introduces the Microsoft 365 Admin Center Agent Registry as the primary tool for agent discovery, lifecycle management, and governance. Patti will explore the registry, review agent metadata, take lifecycle actions, identify ownerless agents, and complete the prerequisite configuration tasks required for Day 2 security labs — including Purview Audit verification, Defender XDR provisioning, and Defender for Cloud Apps initialisation.

3. On the **Agent Overview** page, locate the following metrics and note their current values:

   - **Agent Registry** — total count of agents in the tenant.
   - **Active users in Copilot** — unique users who interacted with an agent in the last 30 days.
   - **Pending requests for agents** — open requests to add specific agents.
   - **Agents without owners** — agents whose owner has left the company.
   - **Agent analytics** — agents by creators, top platforms used to build agents, and active users in Copilot over time.

	![](./media/image33.png)

6. Wait for the search job to complete.

7. Review the results to confirm that audit records are being returned.

   > **Note:** If the search returns no results, this may indicate that no audited activities have occurred yet in the tenant, or that audit log ingestion requires additional time after initial provisioning. This is expected in a new lab environment. Audit records generated throughout this and subsequent labs will be searchable from Day 2 onwards.

## Summary

In this lab, you explored the Agent 365 Overview dashboard and reviewed key governance metrics for the Zava tenant. You inspected all three Zava agents in the Agent Registry, reviewing their metadata, host products, and knowledge sources. You approved the Zava IT Support Agent submission, published the Zava HR Assistant through Teams Admin Center, then blocked and unblocked the Zava HR Assistant to verify that lifecycle controls function correctly. You exported the agent inventory to a CSV file to confirm audit trail capability, and used the ownerless agent filter to check for governance gaps in agent ownership.

You then prepared the Day 2 monitoring infrastructure by verifying that Purview Audit is active and running a baseline audit log search. You provisioned Microsoft Defender XDR, configured Defender for Cloud Apps with Zava Corporation organisation details and managed domain, connected the Microsoft 365 app connector to begin activity data ingestion, and enabled file monitoring.

The Zava agent environment is now fully visible, governed, and ready for security policy configuration in Day 2.
